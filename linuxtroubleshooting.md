# Setting up Remote Inspection of Linux Devices
Forescout can inspect Linux devices remotely via SSH and there is some confusion in the documentation on how to set this up. This is done via a trusted ssh key. This guide will cover two ways:
- Manual deployment
- Scripted deployment

NOTE: This information was provided to the Slack Forescout Community and put together for all to see/use.
