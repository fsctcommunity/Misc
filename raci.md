# What is a RACI?
This file will be the start of the RACI for Forescout. What is a RACI you ask? It defines:
- Who is Responsible
- Who is Accountable
- Who is Consulted
- Who is Informed
This can be built and configured for the different portions of Forescout and will probably be a bit different for each organization.
